# **RAW to JPG Image Compression App**

Although we live in a data-driven world, it’s ironic that we don’t always have enough storage
to keep every single portion of it in our systems. Hence, engineers tend to utilize a widely
used method called data compression to minimize the amount of data stored in memory and
processing pipelines.
Today, we take this concept and translate it into the realm of image data: raw to jpg conversion.
To briefly describe, raw image files are data that is minimally processed from a camera source
to memory. Simply said, it’s an image data type that is most accurately stored in memory as
its physical representation. Although accurate, this form of data consumes massive amounts of
a device’s RAM and can cause detrimental latency in systems that communicate image data
between submodules.
Our project aims to implement the fundamental ideas of the JPEG file type, including variable
compression rate to allow for a trade-off of quality and size, and the ability to save binary files
containing the image’s converted information.f
